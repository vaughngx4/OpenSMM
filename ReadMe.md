## Installation
The application is built for Docker, we will have images on Docker Hub when the application is usable. Here's how to get it running for now:

git clone https://github.com/vaughngx4/OpenSMM.git
cd OpenSMM
```

Copy example .env file and make changes:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
```

Generate mongo init script OR create it yourself:
```
./quick-setup.sh
```

OR

```bash
cp init-mongo-template.js init-mongo.js
$EDITOR init-mongo.js
```

Build/rebuild images and start containers (cache will be used if no changes are found):
```bash
